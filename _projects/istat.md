Modern official statistics are shifting from traditional censuses to **Register-based Censuses**. This transition requires robust tools to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of administrative data. This project, conducted at **ISTAT**, focused on adapting the **Austrian Quality Framework** to the Italian context, specifically developing objective mathematical methods to aggregate quality indicators.

**Objectives**
1. Assess the reliability of administrative registers by adapting a multi-phase quality framework.  
2. Compare and implement objective weighting strategies for composite quality indicators.

**My role**
- Conducted a comparative analysis of four aggregation methodologies: Wroclaw Taxonomic Method, Mazziotta-Pareto Index, Mean-Min Function, and PCA.
- Developed R scripts for data standardization, normalization, and indicator weighting.
- Validated the framework on the Italian "Base Register of Individuals" (RBI) for the "Sex" variable.
- Identified the most reliable sources for the Permanent Census based on objective quality scores.

### The Challenge: Beyond Arithmetic Means

In official statistics, register quality is multi-faceted. Standard assessments often use simple arithmetic means, treating all metadata and data dimensions as equally important. However, in a complex system like the Italian **SIR**, the relevance of documentation might differ significantly from pre-processing accuracy.

The project analyzed 11 registers across four mathematical models to determine which could best handle the "Legal Marital Status" (LMS) variable. The goal was to reach a final Quality Indicator ($q_{.j}$) that truly reflects the reliability of each source.

### Methodology & Code

The pipeline utilized a modular approach to compare aggregation strategies:

1.  **Normalization:** All raw indicators were converted into 0-1 indices to ensure comparability across different units of measurement.
2.  **Wroclaw Taxonomic Method (WTM):** A distance-based approach measuring how far each register is from a "theoretical ideal" unit.
3.  **Mazziotta-Pareto Index (MPI):** A method that penalizes variability among sub-indicators, identifying "unbalanced" registers.
4.  **PCA Analysis:** A synthesis method extracting weights from the first principal component (capturing ~70-75% of total variance).

The analysis demonstrated that while PCA is powerful, it often requires forced post-normalization. The **Wroclaw Method** proved superior for ranking registers as it maintains the context of theoretical maximums without losing information.

### Results: Defining the "Gold Standard"

The final phase applied the **Wroclaw Taxonomic Method** to the Italian **Integrated System of Registers (SIR)** for the variable "Sex", comparing six primary sources, including Municipal Registries (LAC), the Tax Agency (AT), and Social Security (INPS).

By aggregating sub-dimensions such as *Clarity*, *Punctuality*, and *Timeliness*, the analysis revealed:
* **Top Performer:** The **LAC (Municipal Registries)** achieved a perfect score of **1.000**, confirming its role as the primary quality standard.
* **Critical Sources:** Specific registers like **INPSDMAG** and **ISCRNAS** showed lower reliability scores, suggesting they should be used as secondary or comparative sources.

This objective ranking provides ISTAT with a reproducible metric to prioritize data sources, ensuring the Permanent Census is built on the most accurate data available.
