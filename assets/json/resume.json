Currently adopted by several agricultural consortia, the system has enabled estimated annual savings of €30.000 per consortium in water and electricity costs.","Developed a multi-agent LLM-based chatbot for the European IT4LIA AI Factory project, leveraging pre-trained models to assist farmers. The system provides real-time, data-driven advice on irrigation, integrating legal guidelines and technical practices, with support for global (AquaCrop) and region-specific recommendation models.","Built multi-day time series forecasting models for sensor trends using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks, achieving around 5% prediction error through advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and validation techniques."]}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"People's Climate March","location":"Zurich, Switzerland","position":"Lead Organizer","url":"https://example.com","startDate":"2014-04-01","endDate":"2015-07-01","summary":"Lead organizer for the New York City branch of the People's Climate March, the largest climate march in history.","highlights":["Awarded 'Climate Hero' award by Greenpeace for my efforts organizing the march.","Men of the year 2014 by Time magazine"]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","location":"Zurich, Switzerland","url":"https://www.uzh.ch/","area":"Software Development","studyType":"PhD","startDate":"1905-01-01","endDate":"1905-01-01","score":"10","courses":["Theory of Relativity"]}],"certificates":[{"name":"Machine Learning","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-location-dot"},{"name":"Quantum Computing","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Quantum Information","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-envelope"},{"name":"Quantum Cryptography","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag"},{"name":"Quantum Communication","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-calendar"},{"name":"Quantum Teleportation","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"}],"publications":[{"name":"Zur Elektrody/namik bewegter Körper","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1905-06-30","url":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies","summary":"It concerned an interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the properties of light and time.
